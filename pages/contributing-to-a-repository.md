# Contributing to a repository

Now that you have worked with issues and pull requests, it is time to put it all to the test by contributing to the workshop repository directly.

## Exercise

These steps can be done individually, or you can cooperate with your teammate.

### Create an issue

For this, please make an issue **on the original repository** ([click here to directly go to making an issue for the original repository](https://github.com/adraismawur/codeveloping-workshop/issues/new)) indicating that you feel something is missing from the articles on the website.

For example you feel like there should be a page dedicated to pictures of cats, or you would really like to have a page which shows your favorite poem or saying.

If you don't feel like adding something personal or creative, you can also create an issue saying something like "I am done with the exercises".
Note that I will totally upload the result of all this somewhere!

### Undoing all of your hard work

Because we will be contributing to the main repository, and you have been doing a bunch of work on your own copy of it, we need to first reset your fork.
Otherwise we would be swamped with a bunch of merge conflicts as you have all done very similar work before now.
I have added a script for this purpose to the repository, run it using `bash reset-fork.sh`.

### Do the work

Now that we're all set, create a new branch with a name like `feature/cats-page`

Using this branch, create a new .md file under pages/ and start filling it in.
Some tips for making your page:

- You can use HTML in markdown pages if you want
- You can embed images by using the following format `![Image placeholder text](images/path-to-image.png)`. Place the images under images/ in this repository.
- See this page for a full reference: [markdown reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- You can preview your page by going to http://localhost:8000/?page=your-page.md

### Pull request into upstream

Once you are done adding your page, create a pull request for it.
This time you can use the original workshop repository as a base.
The setup for the pull request should look something like this:
[![Expected setup pull request](/images/expected-pr-contribute.png)](/images/expected-pr-contribute.png)

Create the pull request and make sure to describe what you did.
Also include your issue number with a [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) before the issue number so that it is closed automatically!

Finally make sure to assign yourself, and add adraismawur as a reviewer.

If I have comments on your pull request, I will add them.
Otherwise, I will approve the pull request and you can merge it!

### Synchronizing your fork

I promised to come back to these buttons somewhere at the start of these exercises:

[![Sync buttons](/images/sync-buttons.png)](/images/sync-buttons.png)

If other people finish submitting and getting their pull requests approved before you do, you may want to synchronize your fork with the upstream (original) repository.
This can be easily done with the "sync fork" button.

The "Contribute" button is just another way to create a pull request when you have pushed new changes.


### What's next?

This is the end of the exercise material.
If you have extra time, here are a few things to look at and experiment with:

#### Issue templates

The owner of the repository fork can enable issue templates under settings -> general -> features -> issues -> Set up templates.

These can be extremely useful in guiding people how to make issues on your repository.

Add the two built-in templates on github and try making a new issue.

[See this page for more information](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)

#### Contribution guidelines

On larger repositories, contribution guidelines may be present to guide people on how to create pull requests.

This is a file called CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository root.
If this file is present on github, a link to it will be shown whenever someone creates a new pull request.

Generally this file will contain information on what issues to open and which not to open, and how to handle pull requests/forking/etc.
